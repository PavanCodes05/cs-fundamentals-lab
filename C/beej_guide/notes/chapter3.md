# 3. Variables and Statements

The variables are generally considered as a container to hold values, while it is true we can have a better way of understanding this, Variables are a human readable name referred to a numeric address where the value that the variable holds stored in the memory. 

While declaring the variables we might have to give the type to it. C has few types of data

| Type | Example | Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integer  | 2000 | int |
| Float  | 3.14  | float |
| Char | “C” | char |
| String | “Hello world” | char * |

Arguably in C, there might or might not be a separate data type called as boolean, so we can just straightaway call the non-zero values as `true` 0 is `false`
